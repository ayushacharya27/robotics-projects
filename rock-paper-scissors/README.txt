This is a Stone Paper Scissor Playing Program where I have used Google's mediaPipe module Feature to Track hands and then serially Communicating with Arduino To move Servo's.

Its an Unbeatable computer (as there are three cases only) , programmed to always defy the option u r showing.

For instance The Gestures are not trained it's just i used mediapipe's mentioned coordinates to track the fingers and according to that give cases and then serially communicating Through them.

Components used : 
1. Arduino
2. Python Programming (includes modules such as serial , OpenCV, mediapipe)
3. Servo Motors
4. A 3 Fingered Hand Replicating the Original Hand(Cardboard Cutouts).
