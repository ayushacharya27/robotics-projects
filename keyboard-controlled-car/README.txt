In this side project, I have tried to use serial communication to control the Arduino powered car.
I used serial library of Python and selected COM4 (Different for everyone, depends on what port they are using) and gave some commands I want to give to Arduino.
Then used the same to interface the Arduino with the keys Pressed and thus creating a keyboard-controlled car.

Will use this for the main Project, Using RF Modules to Create a Fully wireless Bot controlled by Keyboard Keys.
Components Used: 
1.	Arduino Uno.
2.	Motor Driver (L298N).
3.	Jumper Wires.
4.	Chassis with 2 dual shaft motors.
